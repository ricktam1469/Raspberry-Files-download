# Predix Machine - 16.3.1
#
# Configuration properties for the Predix Machine HTTP Tunnel Server service
#
# Service_PID = com.ge.dspmicro.httptunnel.server
#


# Usage: 
# 
#       Properties set in this file may use the full property
#       name. For example:
#                  
#             <service_pid>.<property_key>=<property_value>



# Note: 
#
#       Properties in configuration files are subject to a delay
#       as they rely on the config-admin and fileinstall bundles.
#
# Format: 
#       type character followed by a quoted string representation of value. 
#          e.g a boolean -  property=B"true"
#       Lowercase type character implies primitives. Type can be omitted for String.
#       Types:
#           T = String            I = Integer            L = Long
#           F = Float             D = Double             X = Byte
#           S = Short             C = Character          B = Boolean
#
#       Array format is property=<type>["<value1>","<value2>"]. 
#           e.g. array of int - property=i["1", "2", "3"]
#       A backslash may be used to break up the line for clarity.

# [Required] Port number the HttpTunnelServer will listen for requests
com.ge.dspmicro.httptunnel.server.port=I"8087"

# [Required] Amount of inactive time (in seconds) for the server to consider a client inactive
com.ge.dspmicro.httptunnel.server.connection.timeout=I"600"

# [Required] Property to set a Max limit to the size of the data buffer for each session in the HttpTunnel Server.
# Max size of the buffer is in increments of 8Kb of data. (i.e. If the Max size of the buffer is 65536
# of 8kb per increment, then the Max Memory size is 512MB)
com.ge.dspmicro.httptunnel.server.buffer.size=I"5000"

# [Required] Property allowing external connections.
# Property to accept external connections when making rdp, ssh, or any protocol requests made to a device.
com.ge.dspmicro.httptunnel.server.accept.external.connections=B"false"

#
# [Optional] Port mapping for devices listening to Http Tunnel Server requests. This parameter allows the 
# user to specify a port on the server to listen to connections being tunneled to the Http Tunnel Client.
# If a device listening to connections is not listed, a random port will be opened and listed in the 
# <Standalone>/deviceports.json file OR <PredixMachineOSGiContainer>/machine/bin/vms/jdk/deviceports.json file
# The array format is = [ \
# 		"<Device_ID>:<Protocol>:<Port>", \
# 		"<Device_ID>:<Protocol>:<Port>", ]
